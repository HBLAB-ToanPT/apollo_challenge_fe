# Vuetify (Default)

This is the official scaffolding tool for Vuetify, designed to give you a head start in building your new Vuetify application. It sets up a base template with all the necessary configurations and standard directory structure, enabling you to begin development without the hassle of setting up the project from scratch.

## ðŸ’¿ Install

Set up your project using your preferred package manager. Use the corresponding command to install the dependencies:

| Package Manager                                                | Command        |
|---------------------------------------------------------------|----------------|
| [yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/getting-started)                   | `yarn install` |

After completing the installation, your environment is ready for Vuetify development.

## ðŸ’¡ Usage

This section covers how to start the development server and build your project for production.

### Starting the Development Server

Config the api base url in the `.env` file.

To start the development server with hot-reload, run the following command. The server will be accessible at [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000):


```bash
yarn dev
```

(Repeat for npm, pnpm, and bun with respective commands.)

> Add NODE_OPTIONS='--no-warnings' to suppress the JSON import warnings that happen as part of the Vuetify import mapping. If you are on Node [v21.3.0](https://nodejs.org/en/blog/release/v21.3.0) or higher, you can change this to NODE_OPTIONS='--disable-warning=5401'. If you don't mind the warning, you can remove this from your package.json dev script.

### Building for Production

To build your project for production, use:

```bash
yarn build
```

(Repeat for npm, pnpm, and bun with respective commands.)

Once the build process is completed, your application will be ready for deployment in a production environment.
